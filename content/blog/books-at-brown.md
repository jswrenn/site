* What's the most expensive required textbook at Brown?
* What's the most expensive class?
* What's the most expensive department?

<!-- more -->

## Methodology
To answer these questions, we'll mine data from [Courses@Brown](https://cab.brown.edu/) (Brown's course-enrollment portal). Crucially, for each course, this portal reports:
  * its [enrollment count](/blog/class-size-paradox/)
  * its required, recommended, and "alternative" textbooks and their price range at the [Brown Bookstore](https://insite.browntextbook.com/home)

So as to not succumb to sensationalism, we'll only consider the *minimum* price of *required* textbooks (unless otherwise noted).

Even so, given the eye-popping expenses that will follow, it's probably false to believe that all students purchase the required textbooks, or that they pay Brown Bookstore's prices for them.

## Most Expensive Books
The **$264.50** *Investments*, by Bodie, Kane & Marcus tops out as the most expensive required textbook of Fall 2020.

## Gross ~~Domestic~~ Department Product
The above ranking of most-expensive courses is dominated by popular classes such as *Investments* and *Foundations of Mechanics*.  In these cases, it is not merely that the course's required textbooks are expensive, but that *many* students are subject to purchasing those expensive books! So, let's ditch our previous individual perspective and instead try to estimate the *gross* domestic product of Brown's courses and departments.

### Course GDP
We'll estimate the "GDP" of a course as its enrollment multiplied by the total cost of its required textbooks. 

With a staggering GDP of **$82,325.00**, CHEM0360 *Organic Chemistry* trounces all competition. The top-25 courses with the highest GDP follow:

| GDP        | Enrl | Cost    | Dept | Code | Title                                                          |
| ----------:|-----:|--------:|-----:|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------------------|

| $33,861.00 |  150 | $451.48 | ECON | 1210 | *Intermediate Macroeconomics*                                  |

### Department GDP
Next, we'll estimate the "GDP" of a *department* as the combined GDP of its courses.

Once again, ECON astounds: if all Fall 2020 economics enrollees purchased their required textbooks at Brown Bookstore's minimum price, together they'd spend **$174,861.60**! The top-20 departments by GDP are as follows:

| GDP       | Dept  |
|----------:|:------|
|$174,861.60| ECON  |
|$119,033.64| CHEM  |
| $88,513.76| POLS  |
| $81,552.38| APMA  |
| $71,487.38| PHYS  |
| $65,223.56| PHP   |
| $60,103.22| BIOL  |
| $55,849.03| SOC   |
| $55,713.02| HIST  |
| $50,784.20| MATH  |
| $49,791.72| ENGN  |
| $46,409.59| ENGL  |
| $31,050.73| CLPS  |
| $29,610.00| NEUR  |

| $23,405.85| IAPA  |
| $18,574.49| LITR  |
| $18,004.94| CSCI  |
| $16,628.56| ENVS  |
| $13,608.38| MUSC  |

### University Textbook GDP

Finally, we'll estimate the *university's* textbook GDP as the combined GDP of its departments: **$1,268,445.51** in Fall 2020!
